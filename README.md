# Graph Traversal

## Graph data

This is a minimal example, so I've stored the graph using an adjacency list which is nothing more than a dictionary of dictionaries. The keys are the nodes of the graph and the values are then dictionaries whose keys are adjacent nodes with edge weights given by the corresponding value.

## Breadth First

The starting point is a classical Breadth First Traversal.
